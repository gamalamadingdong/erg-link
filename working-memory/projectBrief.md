# Project Brief: Erg Racer

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-28
**Project Phase**: Planning

## Core Mission

Build a modern, wireless indoor rowing racing platform designed specifically for rowing clubs. The system enables easy setup of individual and team races (doubles, quads, mixed) without cables or dedicated PCs, lowering the barrier to entry for regular club events and increasing member engagement through a visually balanced, competitive experience.

## Non-Negotiable Requirements

### 1. Zero-Friction Setup & Management
- **Wireless Only**: Must connect to Performance Monitors (PM5) via Bluetooth. No cables.
- **Platform Agnostic**: Admin interface must run on any modern browser (Tablet, PC, Mac) for easy room display.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support on-the-fly changes (shuffling boats, handling no-shows) without restarting everything.

### 2. "Walk-on" User Experience
- **No Mandatory Accounts**: Members must be able to sit down and race immediately as guests.
- **Seat Independence**: Racers can use any machine; software mapping handles the assignment.
- **Automated Data**: Individual data must be savable/exportable (e.g., to Concept2 Logbook) even from team boats, without manual spreadsheets.

### 3. Balanced Visual Experience
- **"Pragmatic Engagement"**: A visual style that sits between "boring 2D spreadsheets" and "confusing 3D metaverses".
- **Clarity**: distinct visualization of team boats vs individuals.
- **Legibility**: easy to see standings at a glance on a room display.

## Success Criteria

1. **Setup Time**: An admin can set up a 6-lane mixed-boat race in < 2 minutes.
2. **Connectivity**: Stable Bluetooth connection for 8+ ergs simultaneously.
3. **Engagement**: "Wow" factor from users on the race visualization (proven by user feedback).
4. **Reliability**: Zero race crashes during a 1-hour session.

## What This Project IS NOT

- ❌ A fully immersive 3D "Metaverse" (like Zwift/EXR) - focus is on simple, clear competition.
- ❌ A single-player training app - focus is on group/club mechanics.
- ❌ Hardwired hardware solution - no proprietary dongles or cables.

## Business Context

**Target User**: Rowing Club Coaches/Administrators (Buyer) and Club Members (User).
**Use Case**: Weekly club "fight nights" or team training pieces.
**Priority**: **Ease of Use** (User Experience) > Visual Fidelity > Advanced Analytics.
