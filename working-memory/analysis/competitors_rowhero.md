## What Is RowHero?

RowHero is a **Native Mobile App** (iOS/Android) that does **exactly** what we've been designing:

> "Your rowers' phones connect directly with the Concept2 and send their workout data to you."

## How It Works

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Coach creates team | Coach signs up, creates team, generates invite link |
| 2. Athletes download app | iOS App Store / Google Play |
| 3. Athletes join team | Enter team code or scan QR |
| 4. Athletes connect to PM5 | Bluetooth pairing via app |
| 5. Live data streams | Coach sees real-time splits on their device |
| 6. Post-workout export | One-tap export to Excel |

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Live Team Dashboard** | Coach sees all athletes' current splits mid-piece |
| **Force Curve Display** | Visual feedback on technique |
| **Pacing Analysis** | Highlights "off-strokes" (10+ splits off average) |
| **Heart Rate Zones** | Optional HR monitor integration |
| **Workout Scheduling** | Coach pre-defines workouts, athletes see on home screen |
| **Auto-Save & PR Tracking** | Workouts auto-logged, PRs highlighted |
| **Coxswain Backup** | If athlete forgets phone, coxswain can log on their behalf |

## Pricing

Not immediately visible. "Request a Demo" suggests B2B sales model.

## What RowHero Validates

1. ✅ **Native App is the way** - They use iOS/Android app, not web.
2. ✅ **BYOD model works** - Athletes' own phones as "bridge".
3. ✅ **Real-time streaming** - Coach dashboard with live data.
4. ✅ **Team-centric** - Roster management, workout scheduling.

## Gaps / Differentiation Opportunities

### The Adoption Problem

> "Adoption is notoriously challenging." - Forum User (Aquaman)

RowHero requires:
- 💰 Paid subscription
- 📝 Account creation
- 👥 Team management overhead
- 🎯 Coach-driven setup

**This creates friction.** If an athlete forgets their phone or doesn't feel like opening the app, data is lost.

### The Lightweight Alternative

What if the tool was so lightweight that athletes just... use it?

| RowHero (Heavy) | Bridge (Lightweight) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Paid SaaS | Free / Open Source |
| Full account required | Guest mode (no signup) |
| Coach schedules workouts | Athlete just connects |
| Team management focus | Data capture focus |
| Feature-rich dashboard | Simple "it works" UX |

**Core Insight**: The value is in **capturing data that would otherwise be lost**. Whether it's racing or just a random Tuesday workout, if the data is captured, it can be analyzed later.

### Differentiation Strategy

1. **Zero Friction**: Scan QR → Connect → Row. No account needed for basic use.
2. **Free Tier**: Individual athletes can use it for free (data goes to cloud).
3. **Racing Mode**: Head-to-head visual that RowHero doesn't emphasize.
4. **Integration**: Feed data into `train-better` or other platforms.
5. **Open Source Option**: Schools/clubs can self-host if they want.
