# Development Planning Specification

## AI-Assisted Development Workflow

This document provides a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted development of {{PROJECT_NAME}} using the SGE template. The planning documents in this folder work together to create a systematic approach to building high-quality applications.

## Planning Document Overview

### Core Planning Documents

#### 1. Market Research & Analysis (`market-research.md`)
**Purpose:** Understand the market landscape and validate your business idea
**When to Use:** Before starting development to ensure market fit
**AI Collaboration:** Use AI to analyze competitor features, identify market gaps, and validate assumptions

#### 2. Product Requirements Document (`product-requirements.md`)
**Purpose:** Define what you're building and why
**When to Use:** After market research, before technical planning
**AI Collaboration:** Use AI to refine user stories, identify edge cases, and validate feature priorities

#### 3. Technical Specification (`technical-specification.md`)
**Purpose:** Define how you'll build the product technically
**When to Use:** After PRD completion, before implementation
**AI Collaboration:** Use AI to review architecture decisions, identify potential issues, and optimize technical approaches

#### 4. Critical Requirements (`critical-requirements.md`)
**Purpose:** Define non-negotiable requirements and success criteria
**When to Use:** Throughout development to maintain focus on critical features
**AI Collaboration:** Use AI to validate requirements, identify risks, and ensure nothing critical is missed

## AI Collaboration Best Practices

### Effective AI Prompting Strategies

#### Context-Rich Prompts
Always provide comprehensive context when asking for AI assistance:

```
I'm building {{PROJECT_NAME}} using the SGE template (React + Supabase + TypeScript).

Context:
- Target users: [describe your users]
- Core functionality: [describe main features]
- Technical constraints: [any limitations]
- Current progress: [what's implemented]

I need help with: [specific request]

Please provide production-ready solutions with proper TypeScript types.
```

#### Iterative Refinement
Use AI for multiple rounds of refinement:

1. **Initial Implementation** - Get basic working solution
2. **Code Review** - Ask AI to review and suggest improvements
3. **Edge Cases** - Identify and handle edge cases
4. **Optimization** - Optimize for performance and maintainability

#### Validation and Testing
Use AI to validate your work:

```
Review this [component/function/architecture] for:
1. TypeScript best practices
2. React performance considerations
3. Security vulnerabilities
4. Accessibility compliance
5. Mobile responsiveness
```

### Documentation-Driven Development

#### Living Documents
Keep planning documents updated throughout development:
- Update PRD as features evolve
- Maintain technical specification with architecture changes
- Track completed requirements in critical requirements document

#### AI-Assisted Documentation
Use AI to help maintain documentation:

```
Update the technical specification for {{PROJECT_NAME}} based on these recent changes:
[describe what was implemented]

Please update the relevant sections and maintain consistency with the overall architecture.
```

## SGE Template Integration

### Leveraging Template Features

#### Built-in Capabilities
The SGE template provides:
- **Authentication System** - Ready-to-use auth with Supabase
- **Database Schema** - Core tables for user management
- **UI Components** - Tailwind + shadcn/ui component library
- **Mobile Support** - Capacitor integration for native apps
- **Deployment** - Vercel deployment configuration

#### Customization Points
Key areas for customization:
- **Database Schema** - Add custom tables and relationships
- **UI Components** - Create app-specific components
- **Edge Functions** - Add custom server-side logic
- **Mobile Features** - Integrate native device capabilities

### Development Environment

#### Recommended Tools
- **VS Code** - Primary development environment
- **GitHub Copilot** - AI coding assistance
- **Supabase CLI** - Database management and local development
- **Vercel CLI** - Deployment and preview management

#### AI Development Setup
Configure your development environment for optimal AI assistance:

1. **Use descriptive variable and function names** - Helps AI understand context
2. **Add comprehensive comments** - Provides context for AI suggestions
3. **Maintain consistent code style** - Makes AI suggestions more accurate
4. **Keep files focused** - Smaller, focused files are easier for AI to work with

## Quality Assurance Framework
